# 🧠 ML Model Explorer App

A powerful, interactive web app to **train, visualize, and explore machine learning models** without writing any code. Ideal for **educators**, **students**, and **non-technical stakeholders** who want to understand how ML works — using their own datasets.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Upload CSV datasets
- 🧠 Auto-detects task: Classification or Regression
- 🧮 Choose between models:
  - Logistic/Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- ⚙️ Tune model hyperparameters interactively
- 📊 View key evaluation metrics:
  - **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve
  - **Regression:** R², MSE, RMSE, Predicted vs Actual Scatter Plot
- 📈 Visualize feature importances
- 📝 (Optional) Export results as PDF/HTML reports

---

## 🎓 Ideal for Educators

This tool is perfect for **teachers** and **instructors** who want to:
- Demonstrate the difference between ML models
- Explain evaluation metrics visually
- Show the impact of parameter tuning
- Use real-world datasets in class (like Titanic, Iris, or Boston Housing)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **ML/Backend:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas
- **Visualization:** seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
- **(Optional)** PDF/HTML Reporting: pdfkit / WeasyPrint

---

## 🔧 Core Features Overview

1. **CSV Upload**
   - Accept `.csv` files from the user
   - Auto-detects target column (with override option)

2. **Model Selection**
   - Choose between Logistic/Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Task type (classification/regression) inferred from target column

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Adjust sliders for model-specific parameters (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`)

4. **Training & Evaluation**
   - Real-time train/test split
   - Display of metrics and visualizations

5. **Visual Outputs**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve / Precision-Recall Curve
   - Actual vs Predicted plots
   - Feature Importance charts

6. **Export Report (optional)**
   - Generate downloadable evaluation reports (PDF/HTML)
